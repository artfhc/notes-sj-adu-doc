# Email Thread: ADU Punch List Items

## Email 1: Arthur → Rosi (Initial Request)

### ADU - Immediate Fixes and Checks

1. **Downspout extension**: Extend ADU downspout so water discharges 3-5 feet away from the foundation (see image)
   - Reference: `downspout.jpg`

2. **Drywall settlement cracks**: Patch and paint all interior drywall settlement cracks
   - Monitor repaired areas for re-cracking in the next few weeks; if cracks reappear, open drywall and repair properly

3. **Electric panel access**: Replace rough drywall cutouts below the electric panels with flush, finished access panels (see image)
   - Reference: `panel-hole-002.jpg`

4. **Door alignment**: Fine-tune interior door alignment to eliminate catching or resistance

5. **Floor level check**: Check floor level in the bedroom and living room

6. **Entry step**: Confirm entry step height meets code requirements; if not, add intermediate step

7. **Window security**: Verify all windows lock properly and are secured

### Main House / Site Items (Non-ADU)

1. **Stucco repair**: Patch and repair stucco damage and cracks caused by ADU construction

2. **Downspout repair**: Repair and fix downspout damaged during construction

3. **Water tank**: Determine purpose of the extra water tank left onsite and remove it if no longer needed

4. **Material removal**: Remove all temporary materials and wood that were taken out of the garden during construction

As mentioned onsite, we plan to do the final walkthrough after utilities are on and once the above items are completed.

Thanks again, and please let me know if anything needs clarification.

Best,
Arthur

**Downspouts**: We don't extend the downspouts, but you can provide an extender from Home Depot which will divert the water - this will be the least expensive option.

**Interior cracks**: Repairing all interior cracks, yes. And again, we generally only do this after power is on to prevent any missed imperfections, but we will be taking care of it now for peace of mind. We don't want you to worry about the condition of the interior walls.

**Drywall cutouts**: The rough drywall cutouts I sent to the GC who will repair and make look nice 👍🏼 He will choose the best option for this and of course we will approve the final work with you.

**Doors**: The doors are done. No additional work needed.

**Floor level**: Floor level checked in bedroom and we are good 👍🏼 We will do a final walk-through and check levelness after everything is done.

**Entry step**: The step is code! But Kevin is getting a price for adding an additional step and railing for you, and he is also pricing the gutter guards.

**Windows**: All windows were locked prior to our exit.

**Material removal**: We will remove all leftover material by final and do clean out of the ADU.

**Main house stucco**: The GC has the punch list for the main house stucco and siding 👍🏼

Thanks Arthur! We are working on the list and will get back to you once we have PG&E scheduled so we can do a final walk-through.

## Email 3: Arthur → Rosi (Follow-up)

Hi Rosi,

Thanks for the update. I just want to confirm the following items that weren't mentioned:

1. **Extra water tank**: Please verify its purpose and whether it will be removed if it's no longer required.

2. **Amenities / materials removed from the garden**: At the beginning of the project, it was agreed that all amenities and materials deconstructed for the ADU installation would be fully removed by Adore. Some items have already been taken away, but there are still remaining materials onsite. Please confirm these will be fully removed as part of the final cleanup.

I'd appreciate your confirmation on these items before the final walkthrough. Appreciate your help!

Best,
Arthur

## Email 4: Rosi → Arthur (Confirmation)

Hi Arthur,

Yes, these will be removed when we clean the home after all touch-ups and before final walk-through.

We are still waiting for power.
